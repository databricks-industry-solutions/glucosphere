# Glucosphere Deployment Guide

This guide walks through deploying the full Glucosphere stack — data pipelines, ML models, and the dashboard app — to any Databricks workspace using the Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB).

## Prerequisites

- [Databricks CLI v0.220+](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html) installed and authenticated
- Unity Catalog enabled on the target workspace
- `CREATE CATALOG` privilege (or a pre-existing catalog you own)
- Model serving enabled on the workspace
- A Multi-Agent Supervisor (MAS) endpoint deployed (see Step 3 below)

---

---

## Step 1: Authenticate

```bash
databricks auth login --host https://<your-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net
```

Or set environment variables:
```bash
export DATABRICKS_HOST=https://<your-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Variables

Edit `databricks.yml` or override at deploy time. At minimum you need:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `catalog` | UC catalog name | Yes (default: `hls_glucosphere`) |
| `schema` | Schema name | Yes (default: `cgm`) |
| `endpoint_name` | MAS serving endpoint name | Yes (after Step 3) |
| `genie_space_id` | Genie room ID | Yes (after Step 4) |
| `app_name` | Databricks App name | Yes (default: `glucosphere-dashboard`) |

---

## Step 3: Create the Multi-Agent Supervisor Endpoint

The MAS endpoint is a Databricks Model Serving endpoint running a multi-agent supervisor that orchestrates clinician queries. It is **not** created by this bundle — it must be set up separately.

1. In your target workspace, open **Serving → Create serving endpoint**
2. Deploy the MAS configuration from your agent framework
3. Note the endpoint name (e.g. `glucosphere-mas-endpoint`)
4. Set it in your deployment: `--var endpoint_name=glucosphere-mas-endpoint`

---

## Step 4: Create the Genie Room

1. In your target workspace, open **Genie → New room**
2. Add `{catalog}.{schema}.gold_patient_device_readings` as a data source
3. Configure the room with CGM-specific instructions (refer to the existing room at the buildathon workspace for reference)
4. From the room URL, copy the room ID (the hex string after `/genie/rooms/`)
5. Set it: `--var genie_space_id=<room-id>`

---

## Step 5: Build the React Frontend

```bash
cd App
npm install
npm run build
# This produces App/databricks/dist/ which the Flask app serves
```

---

## Step 6: Deploy the Bundle

```bash
# From repo root
databricks bundle deploy \
  --var catalog=hls_glucosphere \
  --var schema=cgm \
  --var endpoint_name=<your-mas-endpoint> \
  --var genie_space_id=<your-genie-room-id> \
  --var app_name=glucosphere-dashboard
```

---

## Step 7: Run the Setup Job

```bash
databricks bundle run glucosphere_setup
```

This runs all data generation notebooks in sequence (01–05), trains and registers the XGBoost models, deploys the forecast serving endpoints, and generates the patient/device registry landing zone data.

> **Note:** The `generate_patient_device_data` task references the Jupyter notebooks in `Data_DataGen_ModelForecast/utils/additional_patient_info/`. If those notebooks need to be converted to Databricks-native format before running, do so with:
> ```bash
> databricks workspace import --format JUPYTER <notebook.ipynb> <workspace-path>
> ```

---

## Step 8: Run the DLT Pipeline

After the setup job completes, trigger the DLT pipeline to build silver and gold tables:

```bash
databricks bundle run cgm_silver_gold
```

Or in the Databricks UI: **Pipelines → glucosphere-cgm-silver-gold-dev → Start**

---

## Step 9: Update App Environment Variables

After creating your MAS endpoint and Genie room, update `App/databricks/app.yaml`:

```yaml
command: ["python", "app.py"]
env:
  - name: ENDPOINT_NAME
    value: "your-mas-endpoint-name"
  - name: GENIE_SPACE_ID
    value: "your-genie-room-id"
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
databricks bundle deploy
```

---

## Step 10: Deploy and Start the App

```bash
databricks apps deploy ${var.app_name} --source-code-path App/databricks
databricks apps start ${var.app_name}
```

Or manage through the UI: **Apps → glucosphere-dashboard**

---

## Target: `hls_amer` (fe-vm-hls-amer workspace)

Added on `feature/dual-baseline-hls-amer` branch for HLS-AMER buildathon work. Backbone is the cleanup branch; only differences are a new bundle target and a render script for `app.yaml` templating.

**Variables (`targets.hls_amer` in `databricks.yml`):**

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `catalog` | `hls_amer_catalog` |
| `schema` | `glucosphere_dev` |
| `warehouse_id` | `d9af05523dafe3a6` (HLS AMER SQL Warehouse) |
| host | `fe-vm-hls-amer.cloud.databricks.com` |

**Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Render app.yaml for hls_amer (rewrites catalog/schema/warehouse in place)
python scripts/render_app_yaml.py --target hls_amer

# 2. Deploy the bundle (job + DLT pipeline + app shell + permission grants)
databricks bundle deploy -t hls_amer

# 3. Run the full setup job (data gen → ML training → endpoint deploy → Genie + KA + MAS creation)
databricks bundle run glucosphere_full_setup -t hls_amer

# 4. After step 3 completes, re-render with discovered IDs and redeploy the app
python scripts/render_app_yaml.py --target hls_amer \
    --mas-endpoint   <name-from-step-3>  \
    --ka-endpoint    <name-from-step-3>  \
    --genie-space-id <id-from-step-3>
databricks bundle deploy -t hls_amer
```

`render_app_yaml.py` reads the resolved bundle vars and rewrites the 7 per-target fields in `App/databricks/app.yaml` (4 env values + 3 resource block names/IDs). It is idempotent — re-run any time you switch target or discover new endpoint/Genie IDs. The committed `app.yaml` keeps the `azure`-target values as the default fallback, so `dev`/`prod`/`azure`/`azure2` deployments don't require the render step.

**Grants preflight — the deployed app's service principal needs:**

- `USE CATALOG hls_amer_catalog`
- `USE SCHEMA hls_amer_catalog.glucosphere_dev`
- `SELECT` on the silver / gold tables consumed by the Flask app
- `CAN_USE` on warehouse `d9af05523dafe3a6` (handled by the `sql-warehouse` resource block in `app.yaml`)
- `CAN_QUERY` on the MAS and KA serving endpoints (handled by the `mas-endpoint` / `ka-endpoint` resource blocks)
- `CAN_RUN` on the Genie space (not yet declared as a resource block in `app.yaml`; handled by `10_Grant_App_Permissions.py` during the setup job)

The `glucosphere_full_setup` job's `grant_app_permissions` task wires most of these automatically once the app and the endpoints exist on the target workspace.

---

## Teardown

```bash
databricks bundle destroy
```

This removes the job, DLT pipeline, and app resource from the workspace. It does **not** delete Unity Catalog tables, volumes, or registered models.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ENDPOINT_NAME not set` | Set `ENDPOINT_NAME` env var in `app.yaml` or App settings |
| `GENIE_SPACE_ID not set` | Set `GENIE_SPACE_ID` env var in `app.yaml` or App settings |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN not set` | Ensure the App is deployed (token is auto-injected by runtime) |
| DLT pipeline fails on `pseudo_incident_7d_labeled` | Run the setup job first; notebook 05 creates this table |
| DLT pipeline fails on landing zone paths | Run `generate_patient_device_data` task first |
| SQL queries return no data | Verify DLT pipeline ran successfully and gold table exists |
| Catalog creation permission error | Request `CREATE CATALOG` privilege or use an existing catalog |
